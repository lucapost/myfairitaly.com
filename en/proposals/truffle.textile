Truffle hunting and tasting tour in San Miniato. Both for individual travellers and groups.Period: through the all year. San Miniato hills are popular for white truffles and *My Fair Italy®* can organize a real truffle hunting for you with a real truffle hunter and his dog. 

Typical white truffle is the most important underground treasure in Tuscany and in particular in San Miniato. Every year San Miniato hosts a National Festival where people can taste a lot of truffle-based products as well as fresh truffles. 

*My Fair Italy®* organize half-day truffle hunting tours: an experience for both your nose and your mouth! On request it is possible to have a truffle-made products tasting tour after the hunting.
