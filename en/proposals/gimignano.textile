h3. SAN MINIATO/SAN GIMIGNANO WITH BIKE

!(thumb)/images/proposal/bicigimignano.jpg(bike in San Gimignano)!

3 day tour between San Miniato and San Gimignano for sport-enthusiasts, in particular cyclists. Period: from spring to autumn. Included: meals, accommodation, bicycle rent.

*Day 1:* Meeting point at the hotel in San Miniato. The hotel was previously a monastery built during the XII Century. It combines the ancient structure history and the medieval atmosphere with the new and efficient standards of comforts. Dinner in the hotel with typical products.

*Day 2:* After a big continental breakfast in the morning, you go (by your own car or with a shuttle-bus) to the Il Castagno –the area where you will find your bike and start the tour in the open air. From Il Castagno you move towards San Gimignano, so that you can visit the “Belle Torri” city which is well-known for its history, arts and culture. From the gentle Tuscan hills of Volterra you cycle to Certaldo, the homeland of Giovanni Boccaccio, the tour continues through the hills of Gambassi Terme and then Il Castagno again. Back to the Hotel (by your own car or with the shuttle bus) and dinner at the hotel with typical local products.

*Day 3:* The countryside near San Miniato. Through the centre of the old city you reach on foot the San Francesco Monastery, founded in 1211 (perhaps in the place where before there was an oratory devoted to San Miniato) which is a huge religious complex, made by several extensions over the centuries. From there you will cycle to Cigoli, picturesque village nearby and then on to San Miniato Basso where you will have lunch tasting wine and local products in a farm which is well known for the production of sparkling white wine. After a healthy steep climb you reach the hotel again. There you can have a relaxing time in the SPA (to book in advance) or you can decide to visit the centre of the city with an English speaking guide (to book in advance).

The level of difficulty is *intermediate*.
