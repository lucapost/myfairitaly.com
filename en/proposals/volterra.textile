h3. SAN MINIATO/VOLTERRA WITH BIKE

!(thumb)/images/proposal/bicivolterra.jpg(Palazzo dei Priori a Volterra)!

3 day tour between San Miniato and Volterra for sport-enthusiasts, in particular wheelers. Period: from spring to autumn. Included: meals, accommodation, bicycle rent.

*Day 1:* Meeting point at the hotel in San Miniato historical centre. The hotel was previously a Monastery built during the XII Century. It combines the ancient structure history and the medieval atmosphere with the new and efficient standards of comforts. Dinner in the hotel with typical products.

*Day 2:* After a big continental breakfast in the morning, you go (by your own car or with a shuttle-bus) to the Il Castagno â€“the area where you will find your bike and start the tour in the open air. From Il Castagno you will cycle to Volterra, so you can visit the city famous all over the word for the alabaster handcraft products. Then the tour continues to Vicarello, little village surrounded by picturesque countryside landscape. Then again to Il Castagno. Back to the Hotel (by your own car or with the shuttle bus) and dinner at the hotel with typical local products.

*Day 3:* The countryside near San Miniato. Through the centre of the old city you reach on foot the San Francesco Monastery, founded in 1211 (perhaps in the place where before there was an oratory devoted to San Miniato). It is a enormous religious complex, made by several extensions over the centuries. From there you will head to Cigoli, picturesque village nearby and then on to San Miniato Basso where you will have lunch tasting wine and local products in a famous farm, well known for the production of sparkling white wine. After a healthy steep climb you reach the hotel again. There you can have a relaxing time in the SPA (to book in advance) or you can decide to visit the centre of the city with an English speaking guide (to book in advance).

The level of difficulty is *intermediate*.
