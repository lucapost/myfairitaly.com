h2. Who we are

*My Fair Italy®* is our business. We are three women with their daily busy life to cope with. We had always worked in the tourism business and with tourists. We are good at problems solving, at organizing people’s time and events. We are really capable to organize and plan events of any size, type and budget. Who "we" are?

She was born for Pubblic Relations. Unable to bore, walking on her high-heeled shoes, she produces ideas nonstop. Giuditta boasts 10 years working in the tourism field. She loves the yellow color, sun flowers and good cooking. If you entrust her a project, be sure not to cancel it: she will finish it even then!

Tel: (+39) 338 8185642

She keeps the counts of everything, she always knows where things are, she always gets the ball even in the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy! She loves mountains, animals and round shapes. She likes reading paper books, but she is really able in blogging, websites and virtual communities. If you are thinking about an holiday in South America, she will convince you to stay there not less than a month.

Tel: (+39) 335 8007518

She is the woman of the impossible missions: she can drive across the whole Italy without losing the concentration on her work. She has worked with tourists for more than 10 years and she can understand what they are going to ask her from their faces, before they speak. She likes Hello Kitty, loves having breakfasts with her friends and playing dog agility (she practices it with all her 4 dogs).
