h2. who we are

First of all , we are 3 women with their daily life to face with. We are moms, we are wives, we have our dreams and our wishes, but even our duties and our troubles. We know the everyday life. And we know how to face it. That is our Daily Bread...

We had always worked in tourism and with tourists. We are good at problems solving, at organizing peopleâ€™s time and at organizing events. We are really able to organize and to plan things. We are good in our job. Just trust us and let us demonstrate! Who "we" are?

She keeps the counts of everything, she always knows where things are, she always gets the ball even in the labyrinth of Italian bureaucracy! She loves mountains, animals and round shapes. She likes reading paper books, but she is really able in blogging, websites and virtual communities. If you are thinking about an holiday in South America she will convince you to stay there not lesser than a month.

She is the woman of the impossible missions: she can drive across the whole Italy without losing the concentration on her work. She has worked with tourists for more then 10 years and she can understand what they are going to ask her from their faces, before they speak.
She loves her breakfasts with her friends, Hello Kitty and Agility Dog (she practices it with all her 4 dogs).
