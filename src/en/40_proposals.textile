Tuscany is the wine country. Italians drink at lunch a little, and at dinner mostly, The wine is an everyday presence, like bread, pasta or olive oil. You know the wine by sampling and experiencing. So why do not experience this kind of activity directly in the farm where wines are producted? A private transfer will pick you up near your accommodation at the time agreed and will take you to the farm where you will spend the whole day or half day just enjoying nature and learning about wines and their production. You will get in touch with a real tuscan farm and the real farmers who work and live there.

The wine tour start meeting the farmer. This is very important in order to understand his philosophy and his way of producing wine. Then the visit to the vineyards. According to the season, you will experience the different phases of the farming and if you are in the right period of the year (summer-end or autumn-start) you will also taste the grapevine directly from the plants!

After you will visit the cellars were the grapes start the process to become wine, and you will be tought about all the phases from the grape harvest up to the bottling. Then, finally you will taste all the wines you have seen in the cellars together with tuscan bread, salami, olive oil and all the typical tuscan products. After the visit to the wine farm you will move to a authentic olive oil mill where you will discover the process of making extra virgin olive oil.

Homer called olive oil liquid gold. In ancient Greece, athletes ritually rubbed it all over their body. Its mystical glow illuminated history. Drops of it seeped into the bones of dead saints and martyrs through holes in their tombs. Olive oil has been more than mere food to the peoples of the mediterranean: it has been medicinal and the fountain of great wealth and power. Olive oil's use in so many dishes and its mounting health benefits make it a must in home pantries and while it's now possible to get good olive oil from places as far flung, olive oils from italy's tuscany region remain the ones by which all others are measured.

After the visit to the olive trees yards and to the mill, you will finally taste the real extra virgin tuscan oil! After each visit and tasting you will have the chance to buy the wine and the oil at the farm and mill shop. And just then you will be picked up to your accommodation again.
